# Healthcare Blockchain
 A local implementation of a secure blockchain application using JAVA.

## The idea
 As time passes, the internet is shifting to more non centralized applications. So in this project we decided to apply this approach to something critical like healthcare records, but in doing so we faced the problem that it has to be highly confidential this is why several layers of encryption were used.

## Running the code
 Simply open the project folder in your favorite JAVA IDE. The next step is to run the project and follow the instructions shown in the terminal

### NOTE:
 To restart the blockchain, all text files withing the project folder should be deleted.
